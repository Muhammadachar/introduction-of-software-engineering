# Introduction-of-software-engineering

Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and 
best practices.the first software engineering conference was held and sponsored by NATO in 1968. The conference gathered international experts who agreed the systematic approach 
of physical world engineering should be applied to software development, as it already was developed with those goals in mind.<br>
* Types of software engineering :<br>
(1) Back And Developer<br>
(2) Full-stack Developer<br>
(3) Developer Engineer<br>
(4) Mobile App Developer<br>
(5) Security Engineer<br>
(6) Data Engineer<br>

he scope of a software engineer's work is diverse and demanding, requiring hard and soft skills that vary across the industry. However, programming languages are the fundamental
skill required of any software engineer.<br>

Here are some of the most commonly used coding languages for software engineers:<br>

(1) Java<br>
(2) JavaScript<br>
(3) Structured Query Language (SQL)<br>
(4) C++<br>
(5) C#<br>
(6) Python<br>
(7) HTML<br>
(8) CSS<br>
Software engineers with more specific skill sets may find themselves using a combination of lesser-known programming languages, such as Ruby, PHP, Rust and Swift.
